<p><b>Transcriber’s notes</b>:</p>

<p>The content of this book has been preserved in its original form as far
as possible. However, because some of the scanned text was indistinct
and difficult to interpret, the transcription is a ‘best guess’ in
some places. The text has many anomalies with regard to punctuation,
capitalisation and use of italics. The Middle English language has
archaic uses of ‘u’ ‘v’ ‘i’ and ‘j’ as well as the long ‘s’ (replaced
with a normal ‘s’ in this transcription). In keeping with the era, the
spelling is non-standard and uses space-saving contractions (equivalent
to present-day use of an apostrophe to indicate omitted letters).
Some of the marks denoting a contraction were indistinct, but in this
transcription all are represented by a tilde (~) above the word.
The text contains many sidenotes and footnotes, some of which were
impossible to differentiate with certainty. Three footnotes (19, 20,
52) lacked identifiable anchor markers within the text, so markers
have been inserted at ‘best guess’ locations and the respective
footnotes identified with two asterisks. The footnotes have been
numbered consecutively and repositioned at the end. A short table of
contents (that was not present in the original) has been added to the
transcription to assist readers.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><i>As I am desirous to satisfie all indifferent
men concerning the occasion and
intent of this my discourse: so I
thought good to direct the same especially
vnto this societie, whereof I am
a member; to testifie both how iustly or
rather necessarily I haue beene drawn
to the vndertaking and publishing hereof: as also how
willing I am to submit my selfe to your learned censure;
the argument of my writing being such as none can better
iudge of then your selues.</i></p>

<p><i>And first I protest vpon that credit which I desire to
haue among you, that I haue not vndertaken this businesse
of mine owne accord, as if I esteemed of mine owne knowledge
and obseruation in this case aboue other mens. For
(if it had beene thought good to haue imposed it vppon others)
I do acknowledge that there are many among vs
better able then my selfe to haue written in this kind, vnto
whome I would willingly haue put ouer my taske. Neither
did I euer find my selfe prouoked hereunto upon any
peeuish humor to contradict or to disgrace any who doe
iudge otherwise of some pointes contained herein, then my
selfe doe: many of them being such as I do loue and affect
well. Neither vpon any fawning humor to please or flatter
any person whatsoeuer; which I doe esteeme more base
then begging. But disclayming both hony and gall, I haue
plainely set downe the true doctrine of Phisicke concerning
that disease which giues to great occasion of distraction among
many good men: especially such as haue not learning
sufficient to resolue them of this point, or not that moderation
and humilitie of spirit to acknowledge their insufficiencie,
and to hearken vnto others whom in all reason they
might thinke able to direct them better in such a case.</i></p>

<p><i>For if it be true that one man cannot be perfect in euery
arte and profession, and therefore in cases out of our
owne callings, we do depend vpon those which haue beene
trayned up in other particular subiects, beleeuing men in
their owne professions: Why should we not prefer the iudgements
of Phisitions in a question concerning the actions
and passions of mans bodie (the proper subiect of that profession)
before our owne conceites; as we do the opinions of
Diuines, Lawyers, Artificers, &amp;c. in their proper Elements.
Neither haue I done this as taking vpon me to reforme the
mindes of men which are not vnder my charge (for I could
willingly haue permitted euery man to enioy his owne opinion:)
But being a Phisition, and iudging in my conscience
that these matters haue been mistaken by the commo&#771; people;
I thought good to make knowne the doctrine of this
disease, so farre forth, as may be in a vulgar tongue conueniently
disclosed, to the end that the vnlearned and rash
conceits of diuers, might be thereby brought to better vnderstanding
and moderation; who are apt to make euery
thing a supernaturall work which they do not vnderstand,
proportioning the bounds of nature vnto their own capacities:
which might proue an occasion of abusing the name
of God, and make vs to vse holy prayer as vngroundedly
as the Papists do their prophane trickes; who are readie to
drawe forth their wooden dagger, if they do but see a maid
or woman suffering one of these fits of the Mother, coniuring
and exorcising them as if they were possessed with euil
spirits. And for want of worke, will oftentimes suborne others
that are in health, to counterfait strange motions
and behauiours: as I once saw in the</i> Santo <i>in</i> Padua <i>fiue
or sixe at one sermon interrupting and reuiling the Preacher,
vntill he had put them to silence by the signe of the
Crosse, and certaine powerlesse spelles</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wherefore it behoueth vs as to be zealous in the truth,
so to be wise in discerning truth from counterfaiting and
naturall causes from supernaturall power. I doe not deny
but that God doth in these dayes worke extraordinarily,
for the deliuerance of his children, and for other endes best
knowne vnto himselfe; and that among other, there may
be both possessions by the Diuell, and obsessions and witchcraft,
&amp;c. and dispossession also through the Prayers and
supplications of his seruants, which is the onely meanes left
vnto vs for our reliefe in that case. But such examples being
verie rare now adayes, I would in the feare of God aduise
men to be very circumspect in pronouncing of a possession:
both because the impostures be many, and the effects
of naturall diseases be strange to such as haue not looked
throughly into them.</i></p>

<p><i>But let vs consider a little the signes which some doe
shew of a supernaturall power in these examples. For if
they say there neede no such signes appeare, because the Diuill
by witchcraft may inflict a naturall disease: then I ask
them what they haue to doe with the Diuell, or with dispossessing
of him, when he is not their present, but hath beene
onely an externall cause of a disease, by kindling or corrupting
the humours of our bodies; which disease as well as
other will submit it selfe to physicall indications: as is
shewed, cap. 1. Wherefore they must needes make him to be
an internall cause, and to possesse the members and faculties
of the bodie, and holde them to his vse: or else they
vnderstand not what they say, when they doe peremptorily
disclaime naturall meanes, and auouch that they speake
certaine wordes, and performe certaine voluntarie motions
vpon his incitation, and are hindred by him from speaking
other wordes which they would faine vtter. And therefore
to this end diuerse signes and Symptoms are alledged by
them, as arguments of a supernaturall and extraordinarie
power inhærent in the body.</i></p>

<p><i>One of their signes is</i> Insensibilitie, <i>when they doe
not feele, being pricked with a pin, or burnt with fire, &amp;c.
Is this so strange a spectacle, when in the Palsie, the falling
sicknesse, Apoplexis, and diuerse other diseases, it is dayly
obserued? And in these fits of the Mother it is so ordinarie
as I neuer read any Authour writing of this disease
who doth not make mention thereof. This poynt you shall
finde proued both by authorities and examples in the 4.
Chapter.</i></p>

<p><i>There also you shall find conuulsions, contractions,
distortions, and such like to be ordinarie Symptoms in this
disease.</i></p>

<p><i>Another signe of a supernaturall power they make to
be the due &amp; orderly returning of the fits, when they keepe
their iust day and houre, which we call periods or circuits.
This accident as it is common to diuerse other chronicall
diseases, as head-aches, gowtes, Epilepsies, Tertians, Quartians,
&amp;c. so it is often obserued in this disease of the mother
as is sufsiciently proued in the 2. Chapter.</i></p>

<p><i>Another argument of theirs is the ofsence in eating,
or drinking, as if the Diuell ment to choake them therewith.
But this Symptom is also ordinarie in vterin affects,
as I shew in the sixt Chapter: and I haue at this time a
patient troubled in like maner.</i></p>

<p><i>Another reason of theirs is, the comming of the fits
vpon the presence of some certaine person. The like I doe
shew in the same Chapter, and the reasons of it, from the
stirring of the affections of the mind.</i></p>

<p><i>Another maine argument of theirs, is the deliuerance
vpon fasting and prayer: which we will imagin to be so in
deed, without any counterfeiting in that point. You shall
see in the 7. Chapter, how this may be a naturall remedie
two maner of wayes: the one by pulling downe the pride
of the bodie, and the height of the naturall humors therof;
a verie conuenient meanes, and often prescribed by our
Authours in yong and lustie bodies: the other by the confident
perswasion of the patient to find release by that means:
which I shew in that Chapter by rules and authorities in
our profession and also by examples, to be a verie effectuall
remedie in curing diuerse diseases of this nature.</i></p>

<p><i>Many other such like instances they may produce,
according vnto euerie ones seurall conceit: which were in
vaine for me to repeat perticulary: vnlesse I knew wherein
they would principally insist. But in the discourse following
I haue as neare as I could described al the Symptoms
of this disease; whereby euerie man may readily find answers
to his seuerall obiections.</i></p>

<p><i>Now to testifie my loue and affection to this societie
of ours, and that I esteeme more of the censure of a fewe
learned and graue men, then of the opinions of a multitude
of other people: I thought good to choose no other persons
to patronize this slender discourse then your selues, who are
best able of any in this land, or any such like societie elsewhere
(that euer I could find) to iudge whether I write true
doctrine or no.</i></p>

<p class="tac mrl10pc">

as occasion may serue to giue testimonie vnto it according
as your iudgements and consciences
shall lead you, I take my leaue this

grieuous. But amongest all the diseases wherevnto
that sex is obnoxious, there is none comparable
vnto this which is called <i>The Suffocation of the mother</i>,
either for varietie, or for strangenesse of accidents.
For whatsoeuer straunge accident may appeare
in any of the principall functions of mans bodie,
either animall, vitall, or naturall, the same is
to bee seene in this disease, by reason of the communitie
and consent which this part hath with the
braine, heart, and liuer, the principall seates of
these three functions;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Altomarus de

and the easie passage which
it hath vnto them by the Vaines, Arteries, and
Nerues. And whatsoeuer humor in other partes
may cause extraordinarie affects, by reason of the
abundance or corruption of it, this part will affoord
the like in as plentifull a manner, and in as high a
degree of corruption: and with this aduauntage
that whereas in the other, some one or two of the
faculties onely one are hurt (as in <i>Apoplexies</i>, <i>Epilepsyes</i>,
<i>Syncopyes</i>, subuersions of the stomacke, &amp;c.) and
not all (vnlesse as in <i>Syncopyes</i> by consent, where the
vitall function ceasing, all the rest must needes
cease) in this case all the faculties of the bodie doe
suffer;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Mercatus lib.
2. cap. 2. &amp; 3.</i></span>
not as one may do from another, but all directly
from this one fountaine, in such sort as you
shall often tymes perceyue in one and the same
person diuerse accidents of contrarie natures to
concurre at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>
<p>And hereupon the <i>Symptoms</i> of this disease are
sayd to be monstrous and terrible to beholde, and
of such a varietie as they can hardly be comprehended
within any method or boundes.

Insomuch
as they which are ignorant of the strange affects
which naturall causes may produce, and of the manifold
examples which our profession of Phisicke
doth minister in this kind, haue sought aboue the
Moone for supernaturall causes: ascribing these
accidents either to diabolicall possession, to witchcraft,
or to the immediate finger of the Almightie.</p>

<p>But it is no maruell though the common people
and men also in other faculties verie excellent may
bee deceyued by the rarenesse and straungenesse
of these matters, which are hidden out of their Horizon
amongest the deepest mysteries of our profession:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Cosmocrit. li. 1

when as Phisitions themselues, as <i>Cornelius
Gemma</i> testifieth. If they bee not verie wel exercised
in the practise of their profession, are oftentimes
deceyued, imagining such manifolde straunge accidents
as their hee mencioneth to accompanie this
disease, (as <i>suffocation</i> in the throate, croaking of
Frogges, hissing of Snakes, crowing of Cockes, barking
of Dogges, garring of Crowes, frenzies, convulsions,
hickcockes, laughing, singing, weeping,
crying, &amp;c.) to proceede from some metaphysicall
power, when in deede (as hee there sayeth) they are
meerely naturall.</p>

<p><i>Auicen</i> also in his Chapter of this disease,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Fen. 21. 3 cap:
26: tract: 4:</i></span>
speaking
of the causes of it, sayth, that there were some
wise Phisitions in his time which said, that the cause
of this disease was vnknowne: Because as <i>Iacobus
de Partibus</i> expoundeth it, they did thinke it to be inflicted
from aboue, yet notwithstanding he setteth
downe naturall causes of it, and a naturall cure.</p>

<p><i>Hippocrates</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. de morbo
sacro in principio.</i></span>
also long before finding this error
to bee helde by some in his time maketh mention
of diuerse of these <i>Symptoms</i>, and sayeth, that hee
doth not see anie thing in them more supernaturall,
or more to bee admired, then there is in Tertians,
and Quartans, and other kindes of diseases:
imputing it either vnto ignorance, and want of experience
that Phisitians of his time did iudge otherwise;
or vnto a worser humor, when as beeing
loath to bewray their owne defects through pride
and arrogancie:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Inscitia palliu&#771;
maleficium &amp;
incantatio.
R. Sc: li, 1. cap. 3</i></span>
and not knowing what to prescribe
would flie vnto diuine causes, and neglecting naturall
meanes for their reliefe, would wholy relie
vpon expiations, incantations, sacrifices, &amp;c. cloaking
their ignoraunce vnder these shadows, and
pretending both more knowledge, and more pietie
then other men: by which course they gained this
aduauntage, that if the patient chanced to recouer,
they should bee highly renowmed for their skill; if
not, their excuse was readie that Gods hande was
against them.</p>

<p>This hee speaketh of the Phisitions of his
time, whome he confuteth principally by two reasons,
which may serue for excellent rules for all
men to discerne such cases by. The first is, that
there is no supernaturall Character in these <i>Symptoms</i>,
as hee proueth by an induction of diuerse of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
them, which in the co&#771;mon opinion were thought
to be aboue nature: yet hee proueth to haue their
naturall causes in the bodie of man as well as others
haue.</p>

<p>The strength of this argument will better appeare
hereafter in the particular <i>Symptoms</i>, which
we are to entreate of: where it shall be made manifest
that the most of them doe both depende vpon
such naturall causes as other diseases haue in our
bodies, and also are oftentimes mixed with other
diseases which are accompted naturall.</p>

<p>It may likewise appeare by this, that whereas all
other diseases are knowne by their notes and signes
which resemble their cause (as <i>Choller</i>, <i>Flegme</i>, <i>Melancholy</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> haue their proper markes, corruption
and putrefaction, their proper notes and malignity
his Character) so there must be some Character or
note of a supernaturall power in these cases (as <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>extraordinary</span>
strength or knowledge or suffering) or
else we haue no cause but to think them naturall.
If the diuell as an externall cause, may inflict a disease
by stirring vp or kindling the humours of our
bodies, and then depart without supplying continuall
supernaturall power vnto it<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> then the disease
is but naturall, and will submit it selfe vnto Physicall
cure. For externall causes when they are already remoted,
giue no indication of any remedy.</p>

<p>The second argument of this is, that these <i>Symptoms</i>
do yeeld vnto natural causes, and are both procured
and also eased by such ordinary meanes, as other
diseases are: <span class="nowrap">and<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> therefore they must needs be
naturall.</p>

<p>The strength of this argument is grounded vpon
the very foundation of our profession which hath
beene layd <span class="nowrap">by<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> <i>Hyppocrates</i> <span class="nowrap">and<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> <i>Gallen</i> long agoe
and euer since confirmed by the practise and obseruations
of all learned men; that diseases are cured
by their contraries. I say <span class="nowrap">contrary<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> both vnto the
disease, vnto the cause, and vnto the <i>Symptom</i>. And
the more exact the contrarietie is; the more proper
is the remedy: as when they are equall <span class="nowrap">in<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> degree
or in power. But what equality of contrariety either
in degree or in power, can there be betweene a
supernaturall suffocating power, and the compression
of the belly or throate. They are disperats in
Logicke, but not contraries. For contrarietie is betweene
such as are comprehended vnder one generall.
And where one is opposed vnto one alone,
and not indifferently vnto many. Neither doe I
thinke, that any man wel aduised, will say that by
compression of those parts, he is able to suppresse
the power of the diuell. The like may be saide of
the application of cupping glasses, of sweete plaisters,
of ligatures, &amp;c. beneath, and of euell smelles
aboue; by all which we do obserue those kindes of
fits to be mitigated: and yet there can bee no such
contrary respect in the&#771; against a supernatural cause,
as is between a remedy and a disease. They are also
procured vpon sweete smelles, vpon pleasant meats
and drinkes, vpon feare, anger, iealousie, &amp;c. as in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
particular causes shall bee farther declared: and yet
no such consent can bee shewed in them with any
supernaturall affect, as that they may any way cause
or encrease it. Wherefore the rule of <i>Hyppocrates</i>
must needes be true; that if these <i>Symptoms</i> do yeeld
vnto naturall remedies, they must also bee naturall
themselues.

And thus much in explanation of
these two arguments of <i>Hyppocrates</i> against the errour
of his time: which notwithstanding hath been
continued in the mindes of men vntill this day, and
no maruell: vnlesse the same corruption which
bred it at the first, had beene remoued out of the
world. And therefore diuers of our Authors doe
make especiall mention of this case wherein they
report the common people to haue beene deceiued
by imagining witchcraft or possession, where indeed
there was none.</p>

<p><i>Amatus Lusitanus</i> reporteth of one <i>Diua Clara</i>, a
maide of 18. years of age, which had euery day
two or three such strange fits, as those that were about
her, gaue out that she was haunted with
an euill spirit.</p>

<p>In those fits euery part of her body was distorted,
she felt nothing, nor perceiued any thing: but
had all her senses benummed, her hart beating, her
teeth close shut together: yet for an houres space or
two she would haue such strong motions, that shee
would weary the strongest men that came at her.
When she had beene three weekes in this case, her
left arme began to be resolued with a palsie, &amp;c. He
being called vnto her prescribed such remedies as
are usuall in this case, and within few dayes recouered
her, to the great admiration of the beholders.</p>

<p><i>Petrus Forrestus</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Obseruationu&#771;
medicin: lib: 10
obseru: 30.</i></span>
maketh mention of another maid
of 22. yeares old, which dwelt with a Burgermaster
of <i>Delft</i> in <i>Holland</i>, who falling in loue with a yong
man, fell also into these fits of the Mother: which
held her many houres together with such violent
horrible accidents, as hee neuer sawe the like: her
whole body being pulled to and fro with convulsiue
motions, her belly sometimes lifted vp, and
sometimes depressed, a roaring noise heard within
her, with crying and howling, a distortion of her
armes and handes: insomuch as those about her
thought her to be possessed with a diuell, and out
of all hope of recouery. He being called vnto her
in Ianuarie 1565. applied conuenient remedies as
there he setteth downe, and in a short time restored
her to her health againe.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Thaddæus Dumus

Many more such like examples might bee produced
both out of authenticall writers in our profession
and out of our own experiences, which yet
do liue (were it not that late examples would bee
offensiue to rehearse:) but these may suffice to show
how easily men vnexperienced in those extraordinarie
kinds of diseases, may mistake the causes of
them: when through admiration of the vnwonted
and grieuous accidents they behold, they are caried
vnto Magicall and Metaphysicall speculations. But
the learned Phisition who hath first beene trained
vp in the study of Philosophy, and afterwards confirmed
by the practise and experience of all manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
of naturall diseases, is best able to discerne what is
naturall, what not naturall, what preternaturall, and
what supernaturall, the three first being properly
subiect to his profession: and therefore they doe
wrong vnto the faculty of Phisicke, and vnto them
selues, and oftentimes vnto others, who neglecting
that light which wee might yeeld them, doe runne
headlong and blindefold into many errors and absurdities.
For preuention whereof I haue breefly set
downe
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 28. obseru.

what the doctrine of Phisitions is concerning
this disease of the Mother, which of all other
is most subiect vnto misconstruction. For that as

what maner the Mother may occasion such strange
and manifold accidents.</p>

<p>I call it an <i>affect</i> in a large signification to comprehend
both <i>morbum</i> and <i>Symptoma</i>. For sometimes
it is either of them, and somtimes both. For
in regard the actions of expulsion or retention in
the <i>Mother</i> are hurt. It may be called a <i>Symptoma
in actione læsa</i>: in regard of the humor to be expelled
which corrupteth and putrifieth to a venemous
malignitie. It is likewise a <i>Symptom in excremento
vteri mutato</i>. And in regard of the perfrigeration
of the Mother, and so of the whole bodie. It is also a
<span class="nowrap"><i>Symptom</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> <i>in qualitate tangibili mutata</i>, not <i>morbus ex
inte&#771;perie</i><span class="nowrap">:<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> because it is suddenly inflicted &amp; suddenly
remoued. But in regard of the rising of the Mother
wherby it is somtimes drawn vpwards or sidewards
aboue his natural seate, compressing the neighbour
parts, &amp; so consequently one another. It may be said
to be <i>morbus in situ</i>, in respect of the compression it
selfe, causing suffocatio&#771; and difficultie of breathing.
It may <span class="nowrap">be<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> <i>causa morbi in forma</i> by causing <i>coarctation</i>
of the instruments of breathing. And sometimes
these are complicated <span class="nowrap">and<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> together with a
venemous vapour, arising from this corrupt humor
vnto diuers parts of the bodie, there will be an euill
position of the matrix also: either because the ligaments,
vaines and arteries beeing obstructed<span class="nowrap">:<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> by
those vapours are shortened of their wonted length,
and so draw vp the part higher then it should be, <span class="nowrap">or<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span>
for that the matrix being grieuously anoyed
with the malignity of those vapours doth contract it selfe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
and rise vp by a locall motion towards the midrif.</p>

<p>I say of the <i>Mother</i> or wombe because although
the wombe many times in this disease doe suffer but
secondarily, yet the other parts are not affected in this
disease but from the Mother:

(<i>Radix suffocationum vterus</i>)
which finding it selfe anoyed by some vnkind
humor, either within it selfe, or in the vessels adioyning
or belonging vnto it, doth by a naturall instinct
which is ingrafted in euery part of the body for his
owne preseruation, endeuour to expell that which
is offensiue: in which conflict if either the passage
be obstructed, or the humor inobedient or malignant,
or the functions of the wombe any way depraued,
the offence is communicated from thence
vnto the rest of the body. The principall part of the
body are the seates of the three faculties, which
do gouerne the whole body. The braine of the animall,
the hart of the vitall, the liuer of the naturall;
although some other parts are plentifully endewed
with some of these faculties, as the stomacke, entrailes,
vaines, spleene, &amp;c. with naturall faculties,
the instruments of <span class="nowrap">respiration<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> with animall and naturall.
These parts are affected in this disease, and
do suffer in their functions as they are diminished,
depraued, or abolished<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> according to the nature &amp;
plenty of the humor, and the temperament and

pag. 400</i></span>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Mercat. pa. 170</i></span>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Merca. pa. 174</i></span>
For
somtimes the instruments of respiration alone doe
suffer, sometimes the heart alone, sometimes two or
three faculties together, sometimes successiuely
one after another, sometimes one part suffereth both
a resolution and a conuulsion in the same fit, or
when as it suffereth in one part and not in another,
as we see oftentimes sense and motion to bee taken
away and yet hearing and memorie to remaine, the
speech failing and respiration good. Sometimes respiration,
sense, and motion do altogether faile, and
yet the pulse remaine good: So that the varietie of
those fits is exceeding great, wherein the principall
parts of the body doe diuersly suffer.</p>

<p>Another diuersitie there is, in the order of these
fits: for somtimes they keep <span class="nowrap">due<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> periods or circuits
yearly or monthly, according to the falling sicknes,
and sometime euery weeke, <span class="nowrap">sometimes<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> euery day,
&amp;c. I know a gentlewoma&#771; in this towne, who for 2.
yeares together neuer missed a fit of the Mother in
the afternoone. The like is hereafter mentioned in
the Essex gentlewo. who for 16. years together had
euery day a fit of the Mother at a certaine houre. <i>D.
Argent</i> and I had another patient, in whome for 10.
weeks together we obserued a fit of the mother euery
saturday. I adde <i>by consent of the Mother</i> to distinguish
those <i>Symptoms</i> or diseases from such as are
caused originally by the part affected. For being procured
but by consent, they endure no longer the&#771; the
fits of the mother do continue. The consent or
communitie by which the matrix hath with those principal
parts of the body is easily perceiued, if wee consider
the anatomy of that part, &amp; the diuers waies whereby
it may and doth communicate with them. The fu&#771;ctions
of this part, besides that which is commo&#771; to all
other for their nutriment deriued from the naturall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
facultie, are 2. the one respecting the preseruatio&#771; of
the whole body, as it is an <i>Emunctory</i> of diuers superfluities
which do abound in that sex.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Gabr. Fallopius

via euacuationis.</i></span>
The other for
the propagation of mankind, where it is to be
conceiued and nourished vntill it be able to appeare in
the world. In regard of these offices this part hath
neede of great varietie of prouision, according as
the vses are manifold. The substance is neruous, for
the great necessitie it hath of sence and motion.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Constant. Varelius
lib. 4. cap. 3</i></span>
It is also <i>Porous</i> for the better entertaining of
the vitall spirits and the necessitie it hath of distention
and contraction.</p>

<p>It is tied vnto diuers partes of the body that it
might the better beare the weight of an infant:
backwards by little strings vnto the lower gut, vnto
the loines and <i>os sacrum</i>:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Gasparus Bauhinus
historia
anatom. p. 71.</i></span>
forwardes vnto the necke
of the bladder and <i>os pubis</i> by certaine membranes
deriued from the <i>peritoneum</i>: on each side it is tyed
vnto <i>ossa illii</i> by a ligament growing from the muscles
of the loynes. It receiueth also for the former vses,
vaines from the liuer, arteries from the hart, and
nerues from the braine and backe, which are all inserted
into the substance of the part, to deriue vnto
it the benefit of those 3. faculties, both for the proper
vse of the part, and for the vse of propagation
and to discharge the whole bodie of diuers superfluities,
which otherwise would be an occasion of many
infirmities in them.</p>

<p>Now according to this description let vs consider
how by consent, the principall partes of the
bodie may bee affected from the matrix.</p>

<p>The partes of our bodie doe suffer by <span class="nowrap">consent<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span>
two manner of wayes. The one is when they
doe recyue some offensiue thing from another
parte which is <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>called</span> <i>Communitas non absoluta</i>.
And this is either a qualitie as in venemous and infectious
diseases, where the malignitie creeping
from one part to another doth alter the qualitie of
the parts as it goeth, and at the last is communicated
to the principall parts, as the head, heart, liuer,
longs, &amp;c. or a substance which either by manifest
conducts, as vaines, nerues, arteries, &amp;c.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Fernel. pathologiæ
li. 6. ca. 16</i></span>
or by insensible
pores (as <i>Hyppocrates</i> saith, our bodies are transpirable,
and transmeable) is conuaied from one
part to another: whether it be a vapour or a humor,
as wee doe commonly obserue in the fits of feuers,
where a vapour arising from the part affected, disperseth
it selfe through the whole body, and affecteth
the sensiue parts with colde or heate, the motiue
parts with trembling, the vitall parts with fainting,
sounding, inequalitie of pulse, &amp;c.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Forestus lib. 10
obseru: 115: in

the naturall
parts with deiection of appetite, subuersion of the
stomacke, &amp;c. vntill nature haue ouercome and
discussed it. In these Feuers also many times humors
are so plentifully sent vp vnto the braine, as
by custome or long continuance they breede some
proper affect there.</p>

<p>The other kinde of communitie is that which
they call <i>Communitas absoluta</i>, wherein the part consenting
receiueth nothing from the other, but yet
is partaker of his griefe: either for <i>similitude</i> of substance
or function, which causeth mutuall compas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>sion:
as all neruous partes haue with the braine:
whereby if any Nerue or neruous part bee hurt or
pricked, the braine suffreth a convulsion, or <i>for
neighbourhood</i> and vicinitie, whereby one part may
offend another, by compression or incumbencie:
as in the prolapse of the Mother, the bladder or fundament
is oftentimes offended in their naturall excretion.
And in this disease which we haue in hand
by the locall motion of it vpwardes, the midriffe
is straightned of his scope, whereby the lunges doe
faile in their dutie, or by <i>reason of connexion or continuitie</i>
which it hath with other parts,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Gal: locorum
affect: 1: cap: 6</i></span>
by Vaines,
Nerues, Arteries, Membranes, Ligaments, &amp;c.
whereby the offence is easily imparted vnto other
partes. Or lastly by priuation of some <i>facultie or
matter</i>, whereof the part hath neede. As in the obstruction
of the <i>Spina Dorsi</i> there followeth a resolution
or palsie of the legges or armes, by reason
that the animall facultie that should giue sence or
motion to the part is intercepted and hindered in
his passage.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Rondeletius
cap 69. Trincauell

Likewise in a resolution of the Muscles
of the brest, as in a wound of that part, or in swounding
the voice is taken away, because the matter of
it which is breath, is either not sufficiently made, or
is carried another way, or not competently impelled
to the organs of voyce.</p>

<p>All these manner of wayes hath the Matrix by
consent to impart her offence vnto other parts. For
there wa&#771;teth no corruption of humor, vapour, nor
euill qualitie, where this part is ill affected, to infect
other partes withall, there wantes no oportunitie
of conueyance or passage vnto any part, by
reason of the large Vaynes, Arteries, and Nerves,
which are deriued vnto it, with which it hath great
affinitie and similitude of substance, besides the
connexion it hath with the heart, liuer, braine, and
backe. It is linked also in neighborhoode with diuerse
partes of great vse, as the bladder, guttes, midriffe,
&amp;c. which are likely to bee warmed when this
part doth burne. <i>According to the varietie of causes and
diseases wherewith the wombe is offended</i>, these <i>Symptoms</i>
doe differ in nature, or in degree. <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>A</span> plentifull

much for explanation of the definition.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Now I come to the kinds and sorts
of this disease, which may bee
reduced vnto three principall
heades, according as euerie part
of the bodie belongeth vnto
some of the three principall
functions which do gouerne the
bodie of man.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Affectus corporis
vel excretionum
vitiæ.</i></span>
Not that euerie <i>Symptom</i> in this disease
doth hurt some of the three functions, for some
are onely molestations or deformities, as sudden
Collickes, windie humors, noyses, alteration of colour,
&amp;c. But because euerie part may well bee mustred
vnder some of these generals: and we doe seldome
see any hystericall affect wherein some one
or mo of the functions are not affected. These functions
as they are distinct in office, so they possesse
in our bodies seuerall seats and haue seuerall instruments
belonging vnto them.</p>

<p>1 The vitall function which by preseruing naturall
heat in a due temperature, maintaineth the
coniunction of soule and bodie togither, hath his
principall mansion in the heart, and from thence by
his Arteries conueyeth vitall spirites vnto euery
member. So as without this wee could not liue:
and therefore it is accounted the principallest function,
because the rest receyue their being from this,
and this fayling they must needes all cease. This
function is performed by the motion of the heart,
and Arteries, which in this affect of the Mother is
drawne into consent as it is either diminished, abolished,
or depraued. The deprauation of this motion
is either when it is too fast and quick, or when
it beates disorderly. The pulse in this disease is oftentimes
too quicke, although it bee weake withall:
but seeing it brings no great offence with it, the
patient doth seldome complaine thereof. The greater
offence is when it beates disorderly, and keepes
no equall nor orderly stroke, but either trembleth
and daunceth in the motion, or else is violently impelled:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Trincauel. li. 4
cap. 24.</i></span>
<span class="sidenote"><i>De partium
morbis et symp.
lib. 5: cap. 12.</i></span>
insomuch as it doth not onely remoue
ones hande being applied to some part where the
Arteries are great and near to the skinne (as lately
appeared in a noble Gentleman of this lande now
dead) but as <i>Fernelius</i> testifieth, hath sometimes displaced
the ribbes, and sometimes broken them
through the violent motion of the heart.</p>

<p>This <i>Symptom</i> is called the palpitation or beating
of the heart, or Arteries whereof <i>Maximillian</i>
the Emperour died, as <i>Crato</i> reporteth, and wherewith
<i>Charles</i> the fift was oftentimes molested, as
<i>Vesalius</i> writeth. It is chiefly to bee perceyued where
the Arteries are great &amp; neare the skin: as vnder the
left ribbes towards the backe, and in the necke: as
you may obserue in Maides that haue the greene
sicknesse, by the shaking and quiuering of their
ruffes, if they sit close to their neckes: where some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>times
through the dilatation of the Arterie there
ariseth a <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>tumour</span> as bigge as ones fist. This <i>Symptom</i>
is euerie where mentioned by our <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>Authours</span>
in this disease and our dayly experience confirmeth
it.</p>

<p>This motion of the heart and Arteries in this
affect of the Mother is oftentimes diminished either
in part or to sense totally. In part, where the
pulse in this disease is weake, slow, obscure, intermittent,
&amp;c. and the whole bodie accordingly feeble
and slow in euery action, for want of influence
of vitall facultie from the heart. It is totally diminished
in that <i>Symptom</i> which is called <i>Syncope</i> or
swounding, the very image of death, where the
pulse is <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>scarcely</span> or not at all perceyued; the breath
or respiration cleane gone: by reason that the heart
wanting his motion, hath no neede of the helpe of
the lungs to refresh it withall, all the faculties of the
body fayling, it self lying like a dead corpse three or
foure houres togither, and <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>sometimes</span> two or three
whole dayes without sense, motion, breath, heate, or
any signe of life at all (like as wee see Snakes and other
creatures to lie all the winter, as if they were
dead, vnder the earth) insomuch as diuerse <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>errors</span>
haue beene committed in laying foorth such for
dead, which haue afterwards beene found to haue
life in them, and haue risen vp in their burials,
whereupon there haue beene lawes enacted, as
<span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a><i>Mercurialis</i></span> reporteth, that no woman which was
subiect to this disease should be buried vntil she had
beene three dayes dead. Or as <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a><i>Alexander Benedictus</i></span>
of <i>Bolonia</i> sayth 72. houres, which commeth to the
same reckoning. <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a><i>Petrus Bayrus</i></span> setteth downe diuerse
reasons why they should not be buried before
three dayes bee ended, besides the experience of
some (as hee saith) that haue beene found aliue in
their graues after they had beene buried. I will refer
the reader for the reasons to the author himself,
and to <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a><i>Forrestus</i></span> in his obseruations.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a><i>Plinie</i> maketh
mention out of <i>Heraclides</i>, of a woman who for
seuen dayes together lay for dead in a fit of the mother,
and was restored againe to life: which (saieth
<span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a><i>Marcellus Donatus</i></span>) is not to be thought a fabulous
tale, seeing it is not repugnant to the rules of Philosophie
and Phisicke. And <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a><i>Galen</i></span> making mention
of the verie same hystorie vnder the name of <i>Apnæa</i>,

<p><span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a><i>Rabbi Moses</i></span> an ancient Author in Physicke, reporteth
also of a woman, that in the fitte of the mother,
did lie six dayes without sense and motion, her
Arteries being waxt hard, and she readie to be buried, and
yet recouered.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a><i>Bottonus</i></span> a late professor of Physicke in Padua,
reporteth of a woman that beeing giuen ouer for
dead in a fit of the Mother, was by such conclusions
as he tried, discouered to be yet aliue, and recouered
her former health againe by such remedies as
he prescribed.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a><i>Forestus</i></span> of <i>Alkmar</i> in north <i>Holland</i>, but lately
dead, setteth downe the like example of another,
that lay in that maner 24. houres, and was by him restored
to health againe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>
<p>The like also he citeth out of <i>Leouellus</i>, in that
place, of one that lay with her eyes shut, and dumb
a whole day, and by conuenient remedies was deliuered
from her fit, and could rehearse all that was
done about her in the time of her fit.
<span class="sidenote"><i>De hominis generat.

But the most
pitifull example of all other in this kinde, is that
which <i>Ambrose Paræe</i> reporteth of <i>Vesalius</i> a worthie
Physition, &amp; for anatomicall dissections much
renowned, who being called to the opening of
a Gentlewoman in Spaine, which was thought to
be dead through the violence of one of these fits,
began to open her, and at the second cut of the
knife she cried out, and stirred her limbes, shewing
manifest signes of life to remaine. The beholders
were exceedingly amazed at the sight, and blamed
the Physition much for it: who though hee tooke
her for dead, yet tooke he great apprehension of
sorrow for that accident, that he estranged himselfe.
After through griefe and remorse of conscience
for his error, pretended (as others say) a pilgrimage
for the absenting of himselfe, and therein died. Many
more examples to this end could I produce out
of <i>Authenticall</i> writers, and late experiences, if it
were free for mee to mention them: but these may
suffice to shew how wonderfully the vitall facultie
is ouerthrowne in this disease, and withall respiration,
sense, motion, and all the functions of the bodie
by reason of this.</p>

  <img class="dropcap" src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The second kind of this disease
is, where the animall facultie
doth principally suffer; and it
is that faculty whereby we do
vnderstand, iudge, and remember
things that are profitable
or hurtfull vnto vs, whereby
also we haue sense and do feele
the qualities of things, and moue to and fro, &amp; performe
diuers other voluntary actions for the co&#771;moditie
of the bodie. For nature had made vs but base
creatures, if she had giuen vs onely the vitall facultie
barely to liue, and the naturall to grow, and to
supply the expence that is daily made of naturall
moisture: If she had not withall giuen vs knowledg
and vnderstanding of such things as we are subiect
vnto, and abilitie to moue our bodies at our pleasure,
to apprehend that which is profitable &amp; to shun
that which is offensiue, &amp;c. And therefore as a facultie
making most for the dignitie and vse of man,
it is placed principally in the braine; from whence
it disperseth his beames of influence into euery part
of the bodie, according to the seuerall vses and necessitie
of each part.</p>

<p>This animall facultie hath this peculiar difference
from the vitall and naturall faculties, that the functi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>ons
of it are subiect vnto our wil, &amp; may be inte&#771;ded
remitted, or peruerted at our pleasure, otherwise the&#771;
in other faculties: For no man can make his
pulse to beate as he list, or alter the naturall functions
at his will and pleasure. But these animal functions
may be abused both by our owne will, and by
the violence of some disease, and by both, as <i>Galen</i>
testifieth, <i>lib. 2. de Symptomatum causis cap. 12</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>De motu musculorum
lib. 2.

That it
may be abused by our owne will, he proueth also in
another place, where he bringeth an instance of a
seruant (<i>serui barbari</i>) who killed himselfe to anger
his maister by holding of his breath.

S. <i>Augustine</i>
saith that he knew a man that could make himselfe
to sweate when he list, by his imagination only. <i>Cornelius
Gemma</i> saith, that he knew one that could
weepe when he list: others that could make their
bodies stiffe like an image, imitate the voyces of all
kinde of creatures, raise a hickocke, and breake wind
as often and in what manner they would.

And S.
<i>Augustine</i> tels of one that would make a kinde of
musicke that way. <i>Adrian Turnebus</i> saw a rogue
that gayned much money by shewing this feate, we
do also daily see that some can counterfait madnes,
some drunkennesse, some the falling sicknesse, some
palsies and trembling, some can play the fooles and
supply the roomes of innocents, some can make
noyses &amp; speake in their bellies or throates, as those
which

Hyppocrates</i> calleth <i>Eugastrimuthoi ventriloqui</i>,
such as was the holy maid of Kent, and <i>Mildred</i> of
westwall, &amp;c. And it is strange to see how young
bodies will be bowed and writhed diuersly, as wee
see in tumblers iuglers, and such like companions.
Hereupon diuers haue counterfaited diseases as I
once saw a poor fellow being arested for a smal debt
cou&#771;terfaited a fit of the falling sicknes, with strange
and violent motions: whereby the creditor in
compassion was moued to release him. Being released
he was well againe, and vnto his friendes seemed
to confesse the cousonage: others haue counterfaited
possessions, either vpon meere deceit or
inticed therto through the conceite of some disease
wherewith they haue beene troubled.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib: 16. cap. 4.</i></span>
But for this
point I referre you to the histories of <i>Agnes Brigs</i>,
<i>Rachel Pinder</i>, <i>Martha Brossier</i>, &amp;c. <i>Ren. Scot</i> tels of
one that being blind, deafe, and dumbe, could reade
any canonicall Scripture, but no Apocripha: But
was discouered by inserting a leafe of Apocrapha:
among the canonicall. Another faining her selfe
to be possessed with a diuell, would answere to any
question made in English, but vnderstood no latine.
Diuers such like examples might bee procured to
shew how the animall functions may be abused by
our owne will. But against our willes this faculty
doth suffer by consent in the suffocation of the Mother
diuersly according to the varietie of offices or
functions which it performeth.</p>

<p>The functions of it are three, the first is called <i>Internall</i>
and principall sence which doth gouerne
and direct all the rest by <i>Imagination</i>, <i>Reason</i> and <i>Memory</i>:
which if it bee hurt either by imminution or
deprauation or total abolishment, then the inferior
functions doe necessarily participate with the of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>fence.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Hebetudo mentis.</i></span>
They are hurt by Imminution when a man
doth not <i>Conceiue</i>, <i>Iudge</i>, or remember so well as hee
ought to doe,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Imprudentia obliuio.</i></span>
as in dulnesse or blockishnesse<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> as wee
call it in vndiscretion, foolishnes or want of iudgement,
in obliuion or forgetfulnes, &amp;c.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Sopor.</i></span>
They are abolished
either in those drowsie affects which wee call
<i>Caros</i>, <i>Coma</i>, <i>veternus</i>, <i>Lethargus</i> &amp;c. or in those astonishing
<i>Symptoms</i> wherein all the animall faculties
are at once taken away,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Apoplexiæ.</i><br /><i>Epilepsia.</i></span>
sometimes with a generall
resolution or palsie, as in <i>Apoplexies</i>: sometimes
with a generall conuulsion, as in the falling sicknes:
sometimes with a
<span class="sidenote"><i>Catalepsis.</i></span>
<i>Stifnesse or congelation</i> of the body,
wherein they lie like an image in the same forme
they were taken.</p>

<p>These internall sences are ouerthrowne either
in part or in whole in this suffocatio&#771; of the mother:
and thereupon it is likened vnto these former diseases:
and this kind is accounted by <i>Auicen</i> to be the
most grieuous of all other, where the imagination
and reason is hurt: and the other which holds them
with conuulsions, contractions, &amp;c. he accounts to
bee the milder and the more vsuall. And therefore
he saith that commonly they can remember
what was done about them in their fit: vnlesse it be
of this most grieuous kinde.</p>

<p>The Internall sence is depraued when a man
doth imagine, iudge, or remember thinges that are
not as if they were, or things that are, otherwise then
they are indeed. Whether they do it in cogitation
alone, or do expresse it by word or deede.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Insania.<br />
Delirium.<br />
Melancholia.<br />
Furor.</i></span>
As
we see in those fooles which we call naturals, in
mad men, in melancholike men, in those that are
furious, in such as do dote, in such as are distracted
through loue, feare, griefe, ioye, anger, hatred, &amp;c.
In some of which they will laugh, crye, prattle,
threaten, chide, or sing, &amp;c. according to the disposition
of the party or the cause of the affect.</p>

<p>These functions are also depraued in too much
wakefulnesse through the commotion of the animall
spirits,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Vigilia.<br />
Insomnium.</i></span>
also in dreames, where somtimes besides
the deprauation of the fantasie they wil walke, talke,
laugh, crye, &amp;c. And lastly in that disease which is
<span class="nowrap">called<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> <i>Saltus Sa<sup>ti</sup> viti</i>, or <i>Saltuosa dispositio membrorum</i>
wherein they will daunce, and leape, and cannot
endure to be quiet.</p>

<p>This deprauation of the internall sences, is so ordinary
in the fits of the Mother, as <i>Horatius Augenius
Epistola</i>. 6. seemes to make it of the essence of this
disease, that the imagination is ever depraued in it.
But <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a><i>Hyppocrates</i></span>, <i>Galen</i>, <i>Auicen</i>, and most of the best
Authors in our profession, do affirme that very often
there happeneth an alienation of the minde in
this disease, whereby sometimes they will waxe furious
and raging depriued of their right iudgement
and of rest.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Priuatio visus<br />
Auditus.<br />
Gustus.<br />
Olfactus.<br />
Tactus.</i></span>
The second function of the animall facultie is
the externall sensitive function; which giueth to the
eye the facultie of seeing, to the eare of hearing, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
the tongue of tasting, to the nose of smelling and to
diuers parts of the bodie the power of feeling.</p>

<p>This function in all these kindes is diminished,
depraued, or cleane abolished, but especially in this
disease of the mother, we do obserue the offence
which is done to the feeling facultie, when the
parts are benummed or do not feele at all, or when
they feele <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>paine</span> and offence, or when they feele
things falsely and otherwise then they are.</p>

<p>Concerning hearing, although <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a><i>Hyppoc. Rhasis</i></span>
and diuers others doe obserue that sometimes it is
hindred: yet it seemes to be in the former kinde
where the internall facultie doe suffer. For <i>Mercatus</i>
puts it as a difference from the falling sicknes, that
in this suffocation of the matrix they doe commonly
heare. The priuation of the other sences of seeing,
tasting, smelling and feeling, are verie ordinarie
in this disease, as you may obserue in the Histories
following, and in these quotations.</p>

<p>The third function is that which giues motion
to the whole bodie. This motion serueth either
for a voluntary vse onely, or for a naturall vse
also. The motions for the voluntary vse are the
free motions of the externall members of our bodies:
as to bowe the whole bodie and the head by
meanes of the backe, to apprehend with the hand, to
stand and goe with the feete and legges, to chewe
with the iawes, to open &amp; shut the lips &amp; eyelids, to
moue the eies, &amp;c. This functio&#771; is <i>diminished</i> in that
affect which we cal <i>lassitudo</i>, werines or vnweldines,
wherein we are not able to move so strongly and
nimbly as we should.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Paralysis.</i></span>
It is <i>abolished</i>, either by a <i>resolution</i> or <i>palsie</i> where
the sound part drawes the sickly part, that is the part
resolued, &amp; depending draws the muscles &amp; nerues
&amp;c. or by a <i>Spasmus</i> or <i>contractio&#771;</i> of them <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>where</span> the
sick part drawes the sound part, that is, the muscle
which is affected, drawes the member which is wel.</p>

<p>A resolution or palsie is either generall of both
sides of the bodie <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>exempting</span> the head, or of one
side called <i>Hæmiplegia</i>, or yet more particular of the
hand, legge, finger, &amp;c. called <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a><i>parapligia</i></span>.</p>

<p>A <i>Contraction</i> or <i>Spasmus</i> is also of like sortes,
sometimes the bodie is held vpright and cannot be
bowed any way in that affect which is called <i>Tetanos</i>,
sometimes it is bowed forwardes <i>Emprostotonos</i>
sometimes backward <i>Opistotonos</i>, somtimes the back
is crookt in some part of it, as in <i>Gibbo</i>, sometimes the
iawes, lips, face, eyelids, &amp;c. are contracted, wherby
they make many strange faces and mouthes sometimes
as though they laughed or wept, sometimes
holding their mouthes open or awry, their eyes
staring, &amp;c. Sometimes the handes, armes,
legges, fingers, toes, &amp;c. are contracted, sometimes
particular muscles in the sides, backe, armes, legs,

from laughing, although diuerse means to that end

houres in a most grieuous fit of the mother, wherin
she lay as if she had beene halfe dead, hearing what
was said about her, but could not speake, nor enioy
her other senses. Sometimes she would bee pulled
as if she had the falling sickenesse, sometimes would
lie still

as if she were in an <i>Apoplexie</i>, sometimes she
would onely stirre her legges, the rest of her bodie
being dull: and although she could not speake, yet
she would crie and laugh by turnes, and then be sullen
and dumpish, as if she were dead againe.</p>

<p><i>Alexander Benedictus veronensis</i> testifieth, that
he saw a woman in a fit of the Mother, that was besides
her selfe, and would sometimes laugh &amp; sometimes
crie. Those that attended her, applied Partrige
feathers vpon coales vnto her nostrilles, and by
chance through want of care there fell a great coale
out of the Chafingdish into her bosome, where it
burnt her, and made a great blister, but she perceyued
it not vntill the next day, and then complained
of her breasts. My selfe had a patient in this Citie
yet liuing and in good health (whome I will name
vnto any whome it may concerne) that endured a
violent fitte of the Mother a whole day together:
wherein shee had many strong conuulsions, and
sometimes did lie as if she had beene dead. Insomuch
as the midwiues would haue giuen her ouer,
and imputed ignorance vnto mee that I woulde
attempt any thing for her recouerie. But her husband
being perswaded by me to make triall of some
meanes which I had prescribed for her, shee was
within three or foure houres deliuered of a childe;
yet knew not of it, vntill shee was throughly recouered
of her fit, which was fourteene or fifteene
houres after, and then she asked her husband what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
was become of her great bellie. I could rehearse two
other such like examples within this citie, which
happened not many moneths since.</p>

<p>But we had of late a most rare example of this
disease in an Essex Gentlewoman of good note,
who being once frighted by squibs, fell into these
fits of the Mother, which held her euery day, and
whensoeuer else she did eate any comfortable meat,
for the space of fifteene or sexteene yeares togither,
with such violent conuulsions, as fiue or six strong
men could scarce hold her downe. Sometimes her
limbes would be contracted, sometimes perticular
Muscles, which would cause swellings in diuerse
parts of her bodie, sometimes she would be without
all maner of sense. And being made beleeue by a
stranger Physition that she was bewitched, her fits
increased vpon her, and grew to be stronger than before.</p>

<p><i>Bartholomeus Montagnana</i> reciteth vp 31. seuerall
<i>Symptoms</i> of this disease which hee obserued in a
Gentlewoman which was his patient. Conuulsions,
swoundings, choaking in the throate, sadnesse and
lamentation, coldnes ouer her whole bodie, dumbnesse,
and yet could heare, drowsinesse, beating of
the heart, trembling of the handes, contraction of
the fingers, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The third kinde of this disease is,
where the naturall facultie doth
principally suffer. This facultie
is of great necessitie for the maintenaunce
of mankinde and according
to the diuerse vses
thereof is distinguished. For
seeing that nature bringes vs not forth into the
world perfect men, in that ripenesse and integritie,
of all humaine actions which afterwards we attaine
vnto, when wee come to full growth, it was
meete to be prouided of such a facultie in our bodies
as might encrease our stature, &amp; strengthen the
instruments of the whole body, for the better perfection
of the actions thereof. And this is called <i>facultas
auctrix</i>. Seeing also that wee are made of a
fluxible moulde which wasteth and spendeth it
selfe many wayes, whereby it standeth in neede of
continuall refection and replie: Therefore it was
meete to be furnished with such a facultie as might
repaire the decay and expence of our substance, by
yeelding continually apt matter for the nourishment
of the bodie. And that is called <i>facultas altrix</i>.
And thirdly seeing, notwithstanding our bodies
are continually nourished with the best food,
yet they must once die as well as other inferiour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
creatures doe: therefore God hath indued vs as
well as other creatures with the facultie of generation:
whereby wee may bee able to make our
kind to continue as long as the world shall endure.</p>

<p>These three naturall faculties haue diuerse others
attending vpon them, as the faculties of <i>Attraction</i>,
<i>Retention</i>, <i>Concoction</i>, <i>Expulsion</i>, <i>Alteration</i>,
<i>Formation</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> Which I will for breuitie sake ouerpasse
with their bare mention, because the <i>Symptoms</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Gal. de tremor.

of these faculties are not so euident to the beholders

and animall faculties are, yet that these are also hurt
in the suffocation of the Mother, appeareth both
by dayly obseruation, and by the authorities of all
both auncient and late physitions who haue written
of this disease.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Some of these
are <i>Symptomata

tongue, I hold it not meete to
discourse to freely of such matters,
and therefore I doe craue
pardon if I do but slenderly ouerpasse some poynts
which might be otherwise more largely stood vpon</p>

<p>The causes of this disease are either internall,
or external. The internall causes may be any thing
contained within the bodie, as spirit, blood, humors
excrements, &amp;c. whereby this part is apt to be offended,
but principally they are referred vnto these
two, <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>blood</span>, and nature.</p>

<p>Blood is that humor wherwith we are nourished:
without which the infant in the mothers wombe
could neither grow &amp; increase in bignesse, nor yet
liue: and therefore it was necessarie that those that
were fit for generation, should be supplied with
sufficient store of this humor, for the vse of this part
wherin the infa&#771;t is to be nourished, for which cause
there are large vaines &amp; arteries deriued vnto it for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the conueyance of bloud thereunto, and there is
greater provision thereof made in womens bodies
then in mens: least this part should bee forced to
withdraw nourishment from other parts of the bodie,
and so leave them weake and consuming.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Defectus.</i></span>
But this prouision of nature is oftentimes defectiue:
as when it is cut off by violent causes, and
the part left destitute of this familiar humor, which
should serue both for the comfort of the infant, and
of the part it selfe: which finding offence thereby
doth communicate it vnto the other partes with
which it hath affinitie according to <i>Hyppocrates</i> doctrine.

<span class="sidenote"><i>Comment. 2 in

Cordæus</i> giues vs an example
of one who by chaunce cutting a vaine in her leg,
whereupon she did bleede plentifully, fell into a fit
of the Mother, and by moist and nourishing diet
was recouered. The reason whereof <i>Hyppocrates</i>
referreth to the ouerdrying of those parts through
large euacuation of bloud, wherby the matrix doth
labour by such motion as it hath to supply it selfe
with moysture from other parts of the body:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib. 4. cap. 22.</i></span>
or as
<i>Mercurialis</i> doth enterpret it, doth impart by communitie
(as is aforesaid) the offensive qualitie vnto
the braine, and by that meanes procures convulsions,
&amp;c. <i>Gallen</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>2.loc. affect.</i></span>
refferreth it into the ouercooling
of those parts which necessarily must follow a large
euacuation of bloud, which coldenesse being very
offensive vnto the nerues and neruous partes by
consent and compassion offendeth the braine also,
and by that meanes may procure the former <i>Symptoms</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Excesses.</i></span>
And as the want and scarsitie of bloud may procure
this griefe, so the abundance &amp; excesse thereof
doth more commonly cause it, where the patients
do want those monethly euacuatio&#771;s which should
discharge their bodies of this superfluitie:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Gal. loc. affect. 6
Pereda in paschalium
lib. 1. cap. 58.
Altomarus.
Syluius.</i></span>
as we see
in strong and lustie maidens, who hauing ease and
good fare inough, haue their vaines filled with plenty
of bloud, which wanting sufficient vent diste&#771;deth
them in bulck and thicknes, and so contracteth them
in their length, whereby the matrix is drawne vpwards
or sidewards, according as the repletion is,
whereupon followeth a compression of the neighbour
parts, as of the midrif which causeth shortnes
of breath, by straightning the instruments of respiration
of their due scope.</p>

<p>But if this bloud wanting his proper vse doe
degenerate into the nature of an excrement, then
it offendeth in qualitie as well as in excesse, and
being detayned in the bodie, causeth diuers kinds
of <i>Symptoms</i>, according to the qualitie and degree
of the distemperature thereof.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Alteratio.</i></span>
This distemperature is either in manifest qualities,

The other substance which most commonly
is found culpable of this disease, is nature or <i>sperma</i>:
which besides the suspition of superfluitie in some
persons, may also receiue diuers sortes of alteration,
and likewise of corruption, able to worke most
strange and grieuous accidents in our bodies. For
as it is a substance of greatest perfection &amp; puritie so
long as it retayneth his natiue integritie: So being
depraued or corrupted, it passeth all the humors of
our bodie, in venom and malignitie. For it must
needs be a vehement and an impure cause that shal
corrupt so pure a substance, which would easily resist
any weake assault: and a substance so pure and
full of spirits as this is, must needes proue most malitious
vnto the bodie when it is corrupted. And
therefore it is compared to the venom of a serpent,
a Scorpion, a Torpido, a madde dogge, &amp;c. which
in a small quantitie is able to destroy or depraue all
the faculties of our bodies at once.</p>

<p><i>Galen</i> comparing the corruption of these two
together, affirmeth that although from the putrefaction
of bloud, diuers most terrible accidents doe
arise, yet they are not so deadly as those which
proceede from the corruption of nature;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Syluius, &amp;c.</i></span>
and proueth
it by this obseruation that diuers women enioying
the benefit of mariage, yet through the suppression
of their ordinary euacuation falling into
this disease, had their respiration and vitall faculties
vntouched, although otherwise they were most
grieuously affected.</p>

<p>Others also hauing those ordinarie matters in good
sorte, yet being widdowes and taken with this grief
haue felt decay in those faculties as well as in the
rest.</p>

<p>How these two substances by consent may affect
the whole bodie according to their seuerall natures,
hath beene shewed before: But one scruple
remaineth here to be discussed, namely how this venemous
matter may lurke so long in our bodies in
silence not shewing it self but at certaine times only.</p>

<p><i>Galen</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Loc. affect. 6. 5.
Petrus Salius de
affect. particu.
laribus pa. 326</i></span>
in the former place declareth this by the
example of a mad dogge, whose venom being receiued
of us, although but by the foame of his mouth,
will remaine sometimes sixe moneths within our
bodies vndiscouered, and then hauing gotten more
strength and ripenes vnto it selfe,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Altomarus.</i></span>
and opportunitie
of conuaying his euil quallity vnto the parts, breaketh
forth to open view by diminishing or peruerting
the faculties of those parts. I had once a patient
in Kent who feeding vpon a mad hogge which
hee had killed for couetousnesse sake, found himselfe
distempered therewith at the first, but within
fiue or sixe moneths after grew suddenly to be starke
madde, and before his death, being by Phisicke restored
to some reasonable vnderstanding, he confessed
the eating of that hogge to haue beene the true
cause of his disease. Diuers reasons may be yeelded
of this as well as of the fits of intermittent agues
of <i>Epilepsies</i>, of sweating, &amp;c. which oftentimes haue
their due recourse by the yeare, moneth, weeke, day
or houre, according to the nature of the humor:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>

which being crude expecteth his concoction in our
bodies and giues no signe of his presence vntill such
a proportion of it be digested and resolued into vapours,
as for the offe&#771;ce therof the part affected is not
able to brooke and for the weaknesse of the expulsiue
facultie not able to auoide out of the bodie: but
filling the vaines, arteries, and the habit of the body,
is communicated to the principall parts; diminishing
or deprauing their functions so long, vntill that
portion of vapours be discussed through naturall
heate: and ceasing againe so long vntill by fermentation
and concoction, another portion of the corrupt
humor shall be digested.</p>

<p>The vniformitie of this humor and of the
heate of concoction causeth the vniformitie of fits.
And this is the cause of the due periods or circuites
which oftentimes are obserued in this disease,
whereof wee haue spoken before: 2 according also
to the condition of the part affected, which seruing
as an euacuatorie to the whole bodie, is accustomed
to such kind of humors and therefore can endure
them better then other parts can.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Quia multum.<br />
Quia prauum.<br />
Quia insuetu&#771;.</i></span>
And this is another
cause why this humor giues no signe of his presence
vntill it may communicate with the principall
partes: which are soone offended either with the
plenty of those vapours, or with the malignity, or
with the vnwonted and vnaccustomed approach of
them.</p>

<p>The externall causes of this disease are either such
things as are ordinary and necessary for our life and
which we cannot shun, as our meate and drink, motion
and rest, sleepe and watching, euacuation and
perturbations of the minde: or such things as happen
vnto vs accidentally, and may bee shunned by
vs, as bathes, ointments, plaisters, cloathes, smelles or
vapours, medicines, venus, noyses, riding, swimming,
sayling, wounds, contusions, falles, biting of
venomous beasts, &amp;c. which may be also referred to
the former kindes. These and such like as they are
the externall causes of all diseases, our bodies being
subiect to be hurt and offended by euery one of
them: so they are oftentimes accessary to this particular
disease.</p>

<p>The aire which compasseth our bodies and
which we breath into our bodies is the occasion of
many infirmities in vs,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Fernel. li. 1. de
morboru&#771; causis.</i></span>
if either it be distempered in
quallitie or corrupted in substance, or suddenly altered.
And this may be the cause why women are
more subiect vnto this disease at one time of the
yeare than at another, according to the constitution
of the ayre: as in the winter time, by reason of
colde and moyst weather the humors of our bodies
are increased and made more crude and grose, and
our pores stopped, whereby expiration is hindered,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Mathaus de
gradi. Mercat.
Rondel. cap. 69</i></span>
But especially wee doe obserue that breathing
in of sweete sauours doth commonly procure these
fittes, either for that the matrix by a naturall propertie
is delighted with sweete sauoures,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Hier. Mercuria</i></span>
as the liuer
and spleene with sweete meates, or because the
animall spirites of the braine beeing thereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
stirred vp to motion, doe by consent affect the matrix
with the like.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Plater. pa. 443</i><br/>
<i>Iacobus Ruffius
de muliebribus
lib. 6. cap. 8</i><br/>
<i>Syluius Guaynerius.</i></span>
And therefore wee doe especially forbid
that they may not smell vnto any sweet thing that
are subiect vnto this griefe: but rather vnto euill
sauoures: which as <i>Platerus</i> thinkes by stirring vp
the expulsiue facultie of the matrix, are a meanes
of the shortening of the fit.</p>

<p>Meate and drinke is the Mother of most diseases,
whatsoeuer the Father bee, for the constitution
of the humors of our bodies is according
to that which feedes vs. And therefore it is
reckoned as a principall externall cause of diseases.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>De nat. muliebri.<br />
Lib. 2. obseru.
28.</i><br/>
<i>Hypp. libro citato
quicquid ederit
aut liberit
ipsam molestat</i></span>
And <i>Hyppocrates</i> in this disease forbids sweete
and fatte meats (<i>a dulcibus et pinguibus abstineat, donec
sana sit</i>) <i>Forrestus</i> telles vs of a Bruers wife of <i>Delft</i>,
who could neuer eate or drinke any thing that
was sweete or pleasant but her fit would take her
a fresh, and thereuppon was faine to mixe
wormewood with euery thing that she did eate or
drinke.</p>

<p>The <i>Essex</i> Gentlewoman of whome I spake
before,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Heurnius de
morbis capitis
pag. 310.</i></span>
could neuer take any comfortable sustenance,
but she was sure to haue a fit of the mother.
The reason of this may be the same which we haue
alleaged of sweet vapours.</p>

<p>The errours about euacuation are also an externall
cause of diseases, and doe breed an internall
cause afterwardes.</p>

<p>As in this disease the want of due and monethly
euacuation,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Altomarus.</i></span>
or the want of the benefit of marriage
in such as haue beene accustomed or are apt thereunto,
breeds a congestio&#771; of humors about that part,
which increasing or corrupting in the place, causeth
this disease.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Hollerius cap.
59. Rond. c. 69.</i></span>
And therefore we do obserue that maidens
and widowes are most subiect thereunto. Motion
and rest being well ordered do preserue health,
but being disordered do breed diseases, especially
to much rest and slothfulnesse is a meanes of this
griefe, by ingendering crudities and obstructions in
womens bodies, by dulling the spirits and cooling
naturall heate, &amp;c. So likewise sleepe and watching,
the one by benumming, the other by dissipation of
the spirits and natural heate, may occasion this
griefe.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Hinc Cicero

Lastly the perturbations of the minde are oftentimes
to blame both for this and many other diseases.
For seeing we are not maisters of our owne
affections, wee are like battered Citties without
walles, or shippes tossed in the Sea, exposed to all
maner of assaults and daungers, euen to the ouerthrow
of our owne bodies.</p>

<p>We haue infinite examples among our <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>Historiographers</span>,
and <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>Phisitions</span> of such as haue dyed vpon
ioy, griefe, loue, feare, shame, and such like perturbations

<p>And concerning this disease whereof we doe

also fall into it

<div id="i_016" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="dropcap" src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="dropcap">The signes of this disease, seeing
they are drawne principally from
the causes and <i>Symptoms</i> before
declared shall not neede any particular
discourse, especially considering
the vse of them belongeth
properly to the Physition, to direct him in his cure.
And therefore I thinke good to ease my selfe of this
labour, which would bee altogether vnprofitable
to the reader.</p>

<p>Concerning the cure also I thinke it not meete
to say more then may concerne the friends and assistants
vnto the patient to looke vnto: referring
Physitions workes vnto Physitions. There are some
things by the friendes to bee performed vnto the
patient in regard of the <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>prese&#771;t</span> fit, &amp; some things in
regard of the cause. In the fit let the bodies bee kept
<span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>vpright</span>, straight laced, and the belly &amp; throat held
downe with ones hand.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Rondeltius
Hollerius.</i></span>
Let heed be taken that they
hurt not themselues by biting their fingers, striking
their armes &amp; legs against hard things, &amp;c. apply euil
smels to their nostrils, and sweet smels beneath <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>tie</span>
their legs hard with a garter for reuulsion sake, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Out of the fit, in regard of <i>Externall</i> causes, remoue
from them all occasions of breeding or in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>creasing
the disease: as sweet sauors, pleasant meats
and drinks, much rest and slouthfulnesse, &amp;c. Also if
<span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>discontinuance</span> of any thing accustomed bee the
cause of this disease, bring it into custome againe: if
want of any thing necessary for their health, let it be
supplied, <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>let</span> their diet be sparing and vpon cooling
things, let them vse much fasting and prayer, and all
other meanes to pull downe their bodies: and contrariwise
abstaine from egges, wine, flesh, &amp;c. If the
perturbations of the mind be any occasion hereof,
let them haue their proper remedies, as anger and
iealousie are to be appeased by good counsell and
perswasions: hatred and malice by religious instructions,
feare by incouragements, loue <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>by</span> inducing
hatred, or <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>by</span> permitting them to enioy their
desires, &amp;c. <i>Galen</i> boasteth that he did euery yeare
cure many diseases by this stratagem of moderating
the perturbations of the mind by the example of
<i>Æsculapius</i> who deuised many songs and ridiculous
pastimes for that purpose. To which end also other
phisitions haue vsed diuers sorts of fallacies to encounter
the melancholike conceits of their patients.
<i>Cardan</i> tels of a Gentlewoman, who finding her self
vexed with many grieuous <i>Symptoms</i>, imagined
that the Diuell was the author thereof, and by <i>Iosephus
Niger</i> was cured by procuring her son to make
her beleeue that he saw three diuels in her looking
glasse, &amp; one great one to driue them out. Another
like policie <i>Marcellus Donatus</i> tells vs of, which a
Physition vsed towardes the Countesse of <i>Mantua</i>,
who being in that disease which we call <i>melancholia
Hyppocondriaca</i> did verily beleeue that she was bewitched,
and was cured by conueying of nayles,
needles, feathers, and such like things into her close
stoole when shee tooke physicke, making her beleeue
that they came out of her bodie. The like
there he mentioneth also out of <i>Trallian</i>, of a woman
who did thinke that she had a serpent within
her, and was cured by the like meanes.</p>

<p>So that if we cannot moderate these perturbations
of the minde, by reason and perswasions, or
by alluring their mindes another way, we may politikely
confirme them in their fantasies, that wee
may the better fasten some cure vpon them:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lib de incant.
adiuratione,
&amp;c.</i></span>
as <i>Constantinus
Affricanus</i> (if it be his booke which is inserted
among <i>Galens</i> workes, <i>De incantatione, adiuratione
&amp;c.</i>) affirmeth, and practized with good successe,
vpon one who was <i>impotens ad Venerem</i>, &amp; thought
himselfe bewitched therewith, by reading vnto
him a foolish medicine out of <i>Cleopatra</i>, made with
a crowes gall, and oyle: whereof the patient tooke
so great conceit, that vpon the vse of it he presently
recouered his strength and abilitie againe.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Si quis incantationem
sibi
prodesse confidat,
qualisicu&#771;q;
sit, cum tamen
suu. it. li. 1. proximé
citato.</i></span>
The like opinion is to bee helde of all those superstitious
remedies which haue crept into our
profession, of Charmes, Exorcismes, Co&#771;stellations,
Characters, Periapts, Amulets, Incense, Holie water,
clouts crossed and folded superstitiously, repeating
of a certaine number and forme of prayers or
Aue Maries, offering to certaine Saintes, pissing
through the wedding Ring, and a hundred such
like toyes and gambols: which when they preuaile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
in the cure of diseases, it is not for any supernaturall
vertue in them, either from God or from the diuell
(although perhaps the Diuell may haue a collaterall
intent or worke therein, namely to drawe vs
vnto superstition) but by reason of the confident
perswasion which melancholike and passionate
people may haue in them: according to the saying
<span class="sidenote"><i>4. Natural. 6.</i></span>
of <i>Auicen</i>, that the confidence of the patient in the
meanes vsed is oftentimes more auailable to cure
diseases then all other remedies whatsoeuer.</p>

<p>Another course hath beene taken sometimes in
these cases, by remouing the cause of these affections,
or by inducing of other perturbations of a diuerse
nature. Whereby as (experience teacheth vs)
most grieuous diseases haue beene oftentimes cured
beyond expectation.</p>

<p>A yong man falling out of fauour with his father,
fell thereupon into the fits of the falling sicknesse,
and continued long and often molested there
with; vntill a reconciliation was wrought with his
father: who sending him a kind letter to that effect,
the yong man was presently deliuered from that
fearefull disease.</p>

<p>A yong Maiden also vpon some passion of the
minde, as it was credibly reported, fell into these
fits of the Mother, and being in one of them, a Physition
then present modestly put his hand vnder her cloathes
to feele a windie tumor which shee then
had in her backe. But a Surgeon there also present
not contented with that maner of examination, offered
to take vp her cloathes, and to see it bare:
whereupon the Maid being greatly offended, tooke
such indignation at it, as it did put her presently out
of her fit.</p>

<p>And it is no maruel that the affections of the mind
doe beare such rule in this disease, seeing we doe obserue
that most commonly besides the indisposition
of the bodie: here is also some Melancholike or capricious
conceit ioyned withall of loue, feare, hatred,
iealousie, discontentment, witchcraft, poysoning,
&amp;c. which being by policie or good instructions
and perswasions remoued, the disease is easily
ouercome.</p>

<p>Other matters of gouernment of them either in
the fit or out of the fit, togither with the cure in
regard of the internall causes, because they are
properly belonging to the Physition, I
do purposely omit.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

provided that:

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
